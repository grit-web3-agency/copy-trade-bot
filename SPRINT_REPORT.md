Payment adapter work (dev/sprint-5-payment-adapter)

- Resolved merge conflicts in src/payments/adapter.ts and unified adapter interfaces to support both legacy on-chain verification and newer server-side adapters.
- Implemented compatibility wrappers in src/payment.ts:
  - formatPlans(), formatSubscriptionStatus(), checkWhaleLimit(), checkDailyTradeLimit(), getTreasuryAddress(), getPaymentMode()
  - Kept formatPlansMessage and other service exports for tests.
- Updated Stripe mock implementation (src/payments/stripeMock.ts) to implement the newer adapter shape (activateSubscription, verifyPaymentTx) while remaining compatible with legacy providers.
- Adjusted bot and webhook handlers to accept both boolean and object return shapes from activateSubscription (backwards compatibility).
- Fixed TypeScript build errors and resolved test failures; ran full test suite (vitest) — all tests passed locally (241 tests).
- Committed changes to branch: dev/sprint-5-payment-adapter and pushed to remote: https://github.com/grit-web3-agency/copy-trade-bot (branch dev/sprint-5-payment-adapter).

Next steps:
- Open a PR from dev/sprint-5-payment-adapter → develop/main as appropriate and request review.
- If reviewers prefer a stricter single adapter shape, consolidate providers to the chosen API and remove compatibility shims.
- Add end-to-end demo/runbook for payment flows when integrating a real provider (Stripe) and CI checks for build/tests.

- src/payments/adapter.ts — unified adapter interface
- src/payment.ts — compatibility wrappers & helpers
- src/payments/stripeMock.ts — updated mock adapter
